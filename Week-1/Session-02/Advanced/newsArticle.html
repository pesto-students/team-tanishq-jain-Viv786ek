    <h1>5:Things to Know About Rattlesnakes and Their Babies</h1>

      Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state known for its
      rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August, making these
      two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children and others
      at high risk of exposure to rattlesnakes bites.

      So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the
      Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of
      Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of Arizona
      with the exception of Maricopa County, providing free and confidential
      poison and medication information to callers around the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls
      from Arizonans of the ages who don't realize they were bitten by a
      rattler. The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting,
      pinch or bite while outdoors to immediately call the center at
      800-222-1222.

      <q
        >We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible
        snakebite or eliminate it,</q
      >
      said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona Poison and Drug Information
      Center.
      <q
        >With snakebite, the sooner the medical treatment, their better the
        outcome, so calling us right away can make a very big difference for the
        victims and the medical teams treating them.</q

      The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes to
      be aware of these five things:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
        camouflaged by brush and grass.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so
        there will be no infamous <q>chica-chica</q> sound before they strike.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very
        dangerous if they bite a human.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or
        while they are biting.
      </li>
      <li>
        It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified
        small cut or wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale
        rattle warning, people can be bitten without knowing what has happened
        until they notice their symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.
      </li>
    </ol>
