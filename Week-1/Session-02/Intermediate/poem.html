      I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />
      Are you - Nobody - Too? <br />
      Then there's a pair of us! <br />
      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>

    <p>
      How deary - to be - Somebody <br />
      How public - like a Frog - <br />
      To tell one's name - the living June - <br />
      To an admiring Bog!
    </p>
